so why am i so unhappy?

you tell me whats wrong.

because, man no amount of grief should ever last this long.

and i dont get it because i work so hard.

i work, i work, its all that i do 

and i still come home to a losing view in the same list of things everyday to do.

no, no, i dont want to hear what you have to say.

its always the same.

do better, do more.

theres a little bit of happiness behind the next door.

the second, the third, the fourth-

oh, wait. im sorry. its not even there anymore.

do i deserve to be happy?

is that what this is? 

maybe thats the case.

maybe happiness is trying to put me back in my place.

i keep having this dreams

and every night is the same.

my future is quickly driving away.

but when i look out the window, the views stays the same.

i cant do this anymore.

man, im just working to live,

and living to die.

happiness hates me.

i cant figure out why.
