So here it is — the first ever ITX build. The goal was something small enough to hand carry between hostel and home, without sacrificing raw power just because of the compact size. Basically: tiny footprint, no compromises.

Most of the parts were hunted down on Facebook Marketplace. Second-hand deals are always a gamble, but the chase made the whole process more fun. Each component felt like a puzzle piece, and piecing them together was extra satisfying knowing the budget didn’t blow up in the process.

This “toaster” of a PC now serves as the daily driver for both programming and gaming. Small, portable, and still packing enough heat to toast bread if left running long enough.
