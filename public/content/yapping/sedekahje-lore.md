# SedekahJe Lore

SedekahJe started as a simple idea during a late-night coding session. The name comes from "Sedekah" (charity in Malay) and "Je" (just/only in colloquial Malay), meaning "just give" - emphasizing the simplicity of giving.

The project initially began as a way to connect donors directly with specific needs in local communities. What made it different was the approach - no middlemen, transparency in where exactly your donations go, and the ability to see the impact directly.

Building it taught me a lot about backend security, payment processing, and managing user expectations. The biggest challenge was creating a verification system that was both trustworthy and not overly complicated.

Though it started small, the experience of building and growing SedekahJe has been invaluable, both technically and in understanding how tech can be used for social impact.
