Electronics has always just been a casual hobby — not some deep passion, just something fun to mess around with. It started with taking things apart. Old phones, dead speakers, broken gadgets — anything lying around that wasn’t being used anymore. Sometimes it was just curiosity, wanting to see what was inside. Other times it was about figuring out why something stopped working.

Eventually, it turned into more than just dismantling. Started experimenting with simple builds — nothing fancy. One of the more successful projects was a DIY speaker. Pulled together some salvaged parts, wired everything up, and to everyone's surprise, it actually worked. Loud enough, clean enough, and just satisfying to hear something made from scraps actually play music.

Not everything went as smoothly though. There was an attempt at building a custom controller that could handle both Bluetooth and FM radio — sounded cool on paper, but in practice? A mess. Connections were unstable, components overheated, and the whole thing refused to cooperate no matter how many times it got rewired. Learned a lot from that one — mostly what not to do.

What makes it fun is that there’s no pressure. No deadlines, no expectations. Just the process of figuring stuff out. Soldering, testing, fixing, failing — sometimes it’s frustrating, but it’s also weirdly relaxing. And every now and then, something clicks and a broken thing works again, or a half-baked idea turns into something real.

It's not something being pursued professionally, and probably never will be. But it’s a space to get hands-on, to learn how things really work under the surface, and to build (or break) something just for the sake of it.
