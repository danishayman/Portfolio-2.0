Electronics has always been more of a side hobby than a serious pursuit. It started with tearing apart old phones and busted speakers just to see what was inside. Eventually it shifted into putting things together too, like a DIY speaker from salvaged parts that, somehow, actually worked.

Not everything went well though. There was an attempt at a controller with Bluetooth and FM radio. Sounded cool, but turned into a total mess. Connections failed, components overheated, and the whole thing refused to cooperate. A solid lesson in what not to do.

That’s the fun of it though. No pressure, no deadlines, just soldering, testing, breaking stuff, fixing stuff. Sometimes frustrating, sometimes relaxing. And every now and then, something broken comes back to life, which makes it worth it.

It’s not something being pursued professionally, and probably never will be. But it’s a space to get hands-on, to see how things really work under the surface, and to build (or break) something purely for the sake of it.
